I covered practicing voicings using visualization briefly in a previous <a href="{{site.github.url}}/jazz/think-in-terms-of-scale-degrees-not-just-notes.html#practicing-this">post</a>, and I think it's worth going over this concept in more detail. 

Let me illustrate an example of practicing with visualization. Let's say you're practice a new voicing. Instead of just playing the voicing and letting muscle memory do the work, you take some extra steps before playing the voicing on the piano.
