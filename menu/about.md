My name is Chris Cheung and I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Computer Science. I will be working as a SWE at Amazon in Seattle starting in the fall. My hobbies include classical and jazz piano and photography.

## My Jazz Background

I started off as a classical pianist, but I started gaining interest in jazz in the later half of high school. My interest began from hearing jazz in some of the anime I watched&mdash;Cowboy Bebop and Kids on the Slope. I soon became a big fan of Bill Evans.

I started playing jazz in college. I took a total of two jazz courses at my college. The first one was a student-run class, which I took in 2017, and it was there that I was exposed to the form of jazz: playing through standards as a band and also getting my first taste of improvisation. I only started to get exposed to the idea of applying scales over chords during the last week of this course. The second course I took was taught by a teacher and this was in 2019. I grew the most from this class. It was a music improvisation class based around jazz, and here I learned a lot of improvisation practicing techniques that I still use to this day. I gained a lot from hearing what my peers played&mdash;all of whom were really great jazz musicians&mdash;and writing my first tune. All the students were required to compose and arrange a tune for our class, and going through this process helped me a lot with my musical maturity. My fondest memories of playing jazz are from this class.

I stopped playing jazz after that course, and started playing again half a year later, relying on free online resources to help me learn. The main resources I use to learn about jazz are _The Jazz Piano Book_ by Mark Levine, Kent Hewitt's Youtube channel, Open Studio, Jimindorothy's Youtube channel, and thejazzpianosite.com.

Right now I only play solo piano. I learned a lot of what I know in jazz without a private teacher, so this blog is a way for me to write down what I learned and how I approach jazz. Personally, I think it's hard to figure out what to practice in jazz compared to classical. Figuring out what to practice next in Classical is straightforward&mdash;you have to practice what's laid out on the music in front of you. For jazz, it's tougher figuring out what to practice. This took me a while to figure out, but I finally ended up getting a system down. This blog will be about a lot of these systems and structures that I've formed and are forming to help me play jazz. Note that a lot of these are based around solo jazz piano as that is my main background.

## Photography

I began taking photos in 2019. I started off digital and branched out to film soon afterwards. I only take photos occasionally when I find the time.
